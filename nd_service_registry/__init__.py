"""Simple service registration class for managing lists of servers.

The nd_service_registry model at Nextdoor is geared around simplicity and
reliability. This model provides a few core features that allow you to
register and unregister nodes that provide certain services, and to monitor
particular service paths for lists of nodes.

Although the service structure is up to you, the nd_service_registry model is
largely designed around this model:

  /production
    /ssh
      /server1:22
        pid = 12345
      /server2:22
        pid = 12345
      /server3:22
        pid = 12345
    /web
      /server1:80
        pid = 12345
        type = u'apache'

Example usage to provide the above service list:

    >>> from nd_service_registry import KazooServiceRegistry
    >>> nd = KazooServiceRegistry()
    >>> nd.set_node('/production/ssh/server1:22')
    >>> nd.set_node('/production/ssh/server2:22')
    >>> nd.set_node('/production/ssh/server3:22')
    >>> nd.set_node('/production/web/server2:22',
                    data={'type': 'apache'})

Example of getting a static list of nodes from /production/ssh:

    >>> nd.get('/production/ssh')
    {'children': [u'server1:22', u'server2:22', u'server3:22' ],
     'data': None,
     'path': '/production/ssh',
     'stat': ZnodeStat(czxid=27, mzxid=27, ctime=1355533229452,
                       mtime=1355533229452, version=0, cversion=5,
                       aversion=0, ephemeralOwner=0, dataLength=0,
                       numChildren=3, pzxid=45)}

When you call get(), the nd_service_registry module goes out and creates a
Watcher object for the path you provided. This object caches all of the state
data for the supplied path in a local dict. This dict is updated any time the
Zookeeper service sees a change to that path.

Since we're leveraging watches anyways, you can also have your application
notified if a particular path is updated. Its as simple as defining a
function that knows how to handle the above-formatted dict, and passing it
to the get() function.

    >>> def list(nodes):
    ...     import pprint
    ...     pprint.pprint(nodes['children'])
    ...
    >>> nd.get('/production/ssh', callback=list)
    [u'server1:22', u'server2:22', u'server3:22']

Example of doing some work with a lock in place:

    >>> with nd.get_lock('/myjob') as status:
    ...     if status:
    ...         print "I got a lock!"
    ...
    I got a lock!

               the Zookeeper services. If Zookeeper is down, it will continue
               to try to connect in the background, while allowing the object
               to respond to certain queries out of the 'cachefile'. This
               option is not very useful without the 'cachefile' setting.

       'cachefile' is a location to save a pickle-dump of our various
                   data objects. In the event that we start up in 'lazy' mode
                   and are unable to reach the backend Zookeeper service,
                   objects are re-created with this cache file instead and
                   we are able to respond to get() requests with the latest
                   saved data.

                   Of important note here, if you have multiple processes
                   using the same file location, they will not overwrite, but
                   rather they will append to the file as they save data. Each
                   object saves to this file immediately upon receiving a
                   data-change from the objects... so its generally very up-
                   to-date.

        'username' and 'password's can be supplied if you wish to authenticate
                   with Zookeeper by creating a 'Digest Auth'.

        'readonly' mode just safely sets our connection status to readonly to
                   prevent any accidental data changes. Good idea for your
                   data consumers.

        'rate_limit_calls' indicates the number of calls to the Zookeeper API
                           that we will allow to pass through unimpeded
                           before we consider whether or not to rate limit
                           them for safety. If None, then this is disabled.

        'rate_limit_time' is the average time in seconds you would like to try
                          to maintain between Zookeeper calls. This is only
                          used if 'rate_limit_calls' above is set.
